# Accessibility Analysis for StudentDataGUI

_Last updated: 2024-06_

## Overview

This document provides an accessibility analysis of the StudentDataGUI application, a browser-based student data management tool built with NiceGUI and SQLite3, designed for deployment in containerized environments (Docker/Podman). The analysis covers the user interface, navigation, compatibility with assistive technologies, and recommendations for improvement.

---

## 1. Application Context

- **Frontend Framework:** NiceGUI (Python-based, renders to browser)
- **Deployment:** Runs in a browser, served from a container (Docker/Podman)
- **Primary Users:** Educators, administrators, and potentially users with disabilities

---

## 2. Accessibility Strengths

### a. Browser-Based Delivery

- **Platform Independence:** Users can access the app from any modern browser, leveraging built-in accessibility features (screen readers, zoom, high contrast, etc.).
- **No Client Installation:** Reduces barriers for users with limited permissions or assistive technology needs.

### b. Semantic Structure

- **Use of Headings and Labels:** The UI code makes use of descriptive labels (e.g., "Braille Skills", "Student Name", "Date"), which are beneficial for screen readers.
- **Consistent Layout:** Thematic frames and cards provide a predictable structure, aiding navigation for keyboard and screen reader users.

### c. Keyboard Navigation

- **Form Controls:** Inputs, selects, and buttons are used for data entry, which are natively focusable and operable via keyboard.
- **No Drag-and-Drop:** All primary interactions are achievable without mouse-only gestures.

### d. Visual Design

- **Font Choice:** Uses "Atkinson Hyperlegible", a font designed for readability, especially for users with low vision or dyslexia.
- **High Contrast:** Labels and headings use strong color contrast (e.g., black text on white backgrounds).

## 3. Accessibility Limitations

### a. ARIA and Semantic HTML

- **Lack of Explicit ARIA Roles:** The code does not show explicit use of ARIA roles, states, or properties. While NiceGUI provides some semantic structure, additional ARIA attributes may be needed for complex widgets.
- **No Landmarks or Skip Links:** There is no evidence of navigation landmarks (e.g., `<nav>`, `<main>`, skip to content links), which can hinder efficient navigation for screen reader users.

### b. Alternative Text and Media

- **Images and Icons:** The codebase does not show explicit use of `alt` attributes for images or icons. If images are present, ensure all have meaningful alternative text.

### c. Focus Management

- **Dialogs/Modals:** If modals or dialogs are used, there is no evidence of focus trapping or restoration, which is important for keyboard and screen reader users.
- **Visible Focus Indicator:** The code does not specify custom focus indicators. Relying on browser defaults may be sufficient, but custom theming should not remove visible focus outlines.

### d. Color and Contrast

- **Custom Theming:** While the default color choices are high-contrast, any future theming changes should be checked for WCAG-compliant contrast ratios.

### e. Error Handling and Feedback

- **Form Validation:** There is no explicit mention of accessible error messages or validation feedback. Ensure that errors are announced to screen readers and visually clear.

## 4. Assistive Technology Compatibility

- **Screen Readers:** The use of standard HTML form controls and labels supports screen reader compatibility, but improvements can be made with ARIA and semantic HTML.
- **Magnifiers/Zoom:** The layout appears responsive and should work with browser zoom and screen magnifiers.
- **Color Blindness:** The current design relies on text and structure rather than color alone, which is positive.

---

## 5. Recommendations

1. **Add ARIA Landmarks and Roles:** Use ARIA roles (`role="main"`, `role="navigation"`, etc.) and HTML5 landmarks to improve navigation.
2. **Implement Skip Links:** Provide a "Skip to main content" link at the top of each page.
3. **Ensure All Images Have `alt` Text:** Audit all images/icons for meaningful alternative text.
4. **Accessible Modals/Dialogs:** If using dialogs, ensure focus is trapped within the modal and returned to the triggering element when closed.
5. **Visible Focus Styles:** Ensure that keyboard focus is always visible, especially if custom CSS is used.
6. **Accessible Error Messages:** Make sure form validation errors are announced to screen readers and are visually distinct.
7. **Test with Assistive Technologies:** Regularly test the application with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver), keyboard-only navigation, and high-contrast modes.
8. **Documentation:** Provide accessibility documentation and contact information for reporting accessibility issues.

## 7. Conclusion

StudentDataGUI demonstrates a strong foundation for accessibility due to its browser-based delivery, semantic labeling, and keyboard-friendly controls. However, enhancements in ARIA usage, focus management, and error feedback are recommended to ensure full accessibility for all users, including those relying on assistive technologies.
