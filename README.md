# StudentDataGUI
Student Data Input GUI with wxPython and sqlite

To use this project, open the helpers.py file and replace the filler material with the appropriate information (names of students, tasks, etc.). Follow the formatting present in the file (separation of items by single quotes ' ' and commas).

This program will create a StudentDatabase folder in your %USERPROFILE%/Documents folder for a sqlite database file and resulting data.
