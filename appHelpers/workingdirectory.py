def create_user_dir() -> None:
    """
    Create or retrieve the user directory path.

    This function determines the appropriate user directory path based on the operating system
    (Windows or POSIX) and creates the directory structure if it doesn't exist. The user directory
    path is typically used for storing application-related data.

    Returns
    -------
    Path
        The path to the user directory.

    Raises
    ------
    NameError
        If the environment variable representing the user directory is not found.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> user_directory = create_user_dir()
    >>> # Use user_directory for storing application-related data
    >>> # ...

    Notes
    -----
    The user directory path may vary depending on the operating system:
    - On Windows, it is typically under "%USERPROFILE%\OneDrive - Davis School District\Documents".
    - On POSIX systems, it is typically under "$HOME/OneDrive - Davis School District/Documents".
